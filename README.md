# Historically üòÑ üçæ 
* A web-based app that gives you the details of simply anything you want to know.

* This project was bootstrapped with [ParcelJS](https://parceljs.org). I'd explain how you can navigate through the project below üëá

## Development

- Run `npm install` in your terminal to get all the dependencies of the project.

- To see this app locally on your machine run this in your terminal
```npm 
    npm start
```
it pops open your browser and loads the app at this address `localhost:3000`

- We've installed prettier as a dependency, run the following command to format your codes.
```npm
    npm run format
```

# Contributing...

* The folder we'd be working on, is the ```src``` it contains two subfolders for now ```components``` and ```scss``` till we add other folders.

- Fork and clone this repository [the forked version] onto your machine.
```git 
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/test.git
``` 
- Make this repository the upstream, so when there is any change you can pull from this reposiory to get the current state of the app.
```git 
    git remote add upstream https://github.com/Caleb335/test.git
```
- Then you can either choose to pull from any of the available branch.
```git
    git pull upstream master || git pull upstream [branch-name]
```
- Create a branch, your branch name should be something related to the feature you'd be working on i.e
```git
    git checkout -b [search-component]
```
- Make your changes and commit them in that branch.git
```git 
    git commit -m "your message"
```
- Push the changes to your current branch, then make a pull request.
```git
    git push origin HEAD || git push origin search-component
```

* # Happy hacking!
